I wrote the code in C language because I have more knowledge in C than the other languages.
Dijkstra's code is ignoring the negative weights despite having low weight value than other non negative weight values.
Since Dijkstra's goal is to find the optimal path , itcannot work with negative weights, since it cannot find the optimal path.
Prims and Kruskal are working fine but in some cases the less weight value ignores the connectivity between two nodes.
In prims and Kruskal if there are negative weight edges they will not affect the evolution of the algorithm.
Prim’s algorithm assumes that all vertices are connected. But in a directed graph, every node is not reachable from every other node. So, Prim’s algorithm fails due to this reason.Kruskal algorithm fails to detect cycle in a connected graph.So in certain cases Kruskal assumes that there is a cycle if evn there is not and fails due to that case.
