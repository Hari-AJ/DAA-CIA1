I wrote the code in C language because I have more knowledge in C than the other languages.
Dijkstra's code is ignoring the negative weights despite having low weight value than other non negative weight values.
Prims and Kruskal are working fine but in some cases the less weight value ignores the connectivity between two nodes.
